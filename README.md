We are using React with Django REST Framework

I wasn't sure to include my venv or not so I will just say what needs to be installed:

1. pip install Django (latest)
2. pip install djangorestframework
3. pip install django-cors-headers
4. npm install
python website/manage.py runserver
npm run cypress
